    "## Summary\n",
    "- The paper discusses the disappearance of the long-run neutrality of inflation on capital accumulation when heterogeneity with respect to borrowing constraints are considered.They introduce a rationale for a new channel in an incomplete market model through which they can explain the hump-shaped relationship between inflation and capital accumulation observed in empirical literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution of the paper to the literature is twofold:\n",
    "- Theoretical: a new channel which is specific to the framework under borrowing constraints and incomplete markets \n",
    "- Quantitative: adoption of an incomplete market production economy by Aiyagari (1994) with money incorporated into the utility function which allows them to produce results that matches the hump-shaped relationship between inflation and capital accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heterogeneity in terms of borrowing constraints\n",
    "The paper talks about 4 main channels through which the impact of inflation on the capital accumulation can be analyzed:\n",
    "- Tobin effect (1965): This is the conventional portfolio substitution effect that arises when individuals switch from holding money to capital when there is no borrowing constraint.\n",
    "- Phelps effect (1973): The negative impact of inflation tax on other distorting taxes, namely capital and labor tax.\n",
    "- Revenue effect: The effect that justifies the rationale for holding more money assets when the agents are borrowing-constrained (valid under binding borrowing constraint)\n",
    "- Insurance effect: The effect that comes into play due to the existence of incomplete markets and borrowing constraints. It is observed when the monetary transfers increase with the inflation creating an extra insurance to households. This effect usually works in the opposite direction of the substitution effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "Authors conducted several experiments. Their results are based on the parameters that are calibrated to match the characteristics of U.S. economy. Here, I will provide a summary of their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual Policy Responses\n",
    "With an inflation rate of 0.75% in the benchmark economy, authors report that:\n",
    "- low and medium productivity workers are net-dissavers\n",
    "- high productivity workers are net-savers\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the borrowing constraint, concavity is observed at low levels of wealth. This portion corresponds to the workers with low or medium levels of productivity, indicating that they are net-dissavers (Figure 1). On the other hand, the high productivity workers are net-savers reflecting their motivation for consumption smoothing for less favorable states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Policy Responses\n",
    "#### Proportional lump-sum transfers and exogenous labor\n",
    "When the increase in quarterly inflation from 0% to 10% is considered, the authors report that (Figure 3):\n",
    "- demand for real money balances decreases continuously\n",
    "- capital stock is increasing with a decreasing rate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redistributive effects of inflation tax\n",
    "This experiment can be described as a helicopter drop with symmetric transfers. The main observations can be listed as the following (Figure 4): \n",
    "- The incentive for self-insurance is dampened by monetary transfers \n",
    "- Hump-shaped pattern for aggregate capital stock\n",
    "- At relatively higher levels of inflation, insurance effect dominates the substitution effect, whereas the latter dominates the former at lower levels of inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Endogenous labor, distorting taxes and redistribution of inflation taxes\n",
    "##### Symmetric lump-sum redistribution of the inflation tax \n",
    "Table 4 reports the main quantitative results of the experiment along with the results that would have been observed under complete markets. It has been shown that the increase in monetary transfers dampens the incentive to work as it provides additional insurance. \n",
    "They further report the results under complete markets to highlight the impact of the borrowing constraints on the non-neutrality of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Change in distorting taxes\n",
    "In this experiment, inflation tax is used by the government to decrease the distorting taxes on capital and labor. The results are reported in Table 4. The observations regarding the channels can be summarized as the following:\n",
    "- Insurance effect is no longer relevant\n",
    "- Substitution effect is still at work, reflecting a positive impact on the capital accumulation\n",
    "- Phelps effect intensifies the positive impact of inflation on the capital stock \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity analysis\n",
    "Authors conducted sensitivity analysis on 3 key parameters:  \n",
    "- Elasticity of money demand\n",
    "- Risk aversion\n",
    "- Borrowing constraint\n",
    "Results are reported in figures 6-7-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    " \n",
    "When market incompleteness and heterogeneity in borrowing constraints are considered, the paper shows that the effect of inflation on aggregate capital stock and output is hump-shaped. They show that inflation has a different impact on agents depending on their ability to adjust their financial portfolio, i.e. whether they are borrowing-constrained or not. \n",
    "Specifically, authors report 2 main effects of inflation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase in precautionary savings motive: This induces an increase in capital stock. \n",
    "2. Decrease in precautionary savings motive: This induces a decrease in capital stock as the redistribution of inflation tax provides additional insurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "They claim that the former one dominates the latter one at lower levels of inflation; whereas, the latter one dominates the former one at higher levels of inflation. \n",
    "They further add that the presence of incomplete markets and borrowing constraints not only explains the  non-neutrality of inflation, but they also have an intensifying effect on the other channels of inflation relative to the complete market models.\n",
